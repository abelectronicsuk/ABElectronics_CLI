# ABElectronics_CLI
Command Line Interfaces for controlling Raspberry Pi expansion boards from AB Electronics UK.

**Note:** Microchip recommends that pin 8 (GPA7) and pin 16 (GPB7) are used as outputs only.  This change was made for revision D MCP23017 chips manufactured after June 2020. See the [MCP23017 datasheet](https://www.abelectronics.co.uk/docs/pdf/microchip-mcp23017.pdf) for more information.
